# Errataca's Polyam Guide

I've been open and/or polyam for more than a decade and have done some reading on it! Some folks have reached out to me asking for my recommendations about books and other resources about poly.

This is a living guide and I'll be adding more to it as I find more good resources and have more time to think more deeply about each resource. These are not affiliate links and I'll make sure to declare any conflicts of interest if any arise.

If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to email me at err@errataca.com.

## Resources

### Books

#### Open Deeply (⭐️⭐️⭐️)
Good for poly newbies and folks opening up a relationship. Covers a lot of the same topics as the other books. Feels somewhat "surface level" sometimes.

#### More Than Two (⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️)
Good for folks opening up a relationship. Goes deeper than the previous book. Good personal stories.

#### The Ethical Slut (⭐️⭐️)
Less about an existing couple opening up. Very hippy. Must buy 3rd ed which has been updated to include nonbinary folk. Has stories from early poly but feels like it's for and from an earlier generation. Covers topics deeply, especially around sexuality. 

#### Opening Up, (⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️?)
Good for couples opening up, G and I read this one 10 years ago when we first started. I don't remember much of it but apparently it worked. Need to read it again in order to give it a real rating.

### Podcasts

#### [Multiamory](https://www.multiamory.com/) (⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️)
Talks a lot about the nuts and bolts of poly. Doesn't spend a lot of time talking about sex, focuses much more on feelings and relationships which I find useful if slightly less fun. Also has a thriving Patreon Discord community (that I'm part of). Esp recommend learning about Triforce and RADAR. They've also published some books which I haven't yet reviewed.

#### [Normalizing Non-Monogamy](https://www.normalizingnonmonogamy.com/) (⭐️⭐️⭐️)

Individual stories and interviews with poly folk. (Featured a childhood friend of mine recently which was interesting!) Less about "how to" and more about "how did". Sometimes feels too long or not applicable but it's always great to hear about people.

### Social Media

#### [Remodeled Love](https://www.remodeledlove.com/) (⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️?)

G is a huge Remodeled Love fan and I've enjoyed the content that she's forwarded me from them! They've published some books, including one on polyamorous parenting, that I have yet to read and review.
