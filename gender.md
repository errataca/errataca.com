## Gender

I don't think myself an expert on this, and my research is more limited than I would like it to be. That said, I wanted to write down some thoughts on gender as a way to work out my own feelings, and the result is below.

**This is currently a work in progress.**

### Gender as a spectrum

I think of gender as a spectrum, and you - as someone reading a site about polyamory and gender - probably do too. You and I have abandoned the idea that one is always masculine or feminine, with nothing in between. We point at the myriad examples around the world of people who do not fit neatly into one of these two boxes when someone hasn't yet reached this realization themselves. Or perhaps you haven't, in which case I hope this essay is persuasive.

But what do we mean, "a spectrum". Is gender a line between "masculine" and "feminine", and one can slide around on that single dimension? Many people hold this belief. However, in this way, gender is like race - a socially-created scale on which to categorize people. Unless told otherwise, you are "man" if you have a penis, you are "white" if your skin lacks pigment. We have tied words called "gender" to a specific set of physical characteristics, and so this spectrum exists, but it is not imposed from outside of humanity.

Let us use the analogy of the color spectrum. We define visible light as photons with wavelengths between approximately 380nm to 780nm - the rainbow. But we can perceive colors that do not exist as single photons, for example fuchsia, which only exists when pure red and pure blue light strike our eye from the same source.

However, "visible" is only true for humans - other animals or technologies can "see" wavelengths far outside this range. We happen to have three color sensor cells approximating our notions of red, green, and blue, and so we define and name color by these standards. Yet humans have been found with four types of cells (tetrachromats), who can tell the difference between colors indistinguishable to the majority. And so we must admit that "color" is a construction on top of physical reality, and that "red" is not a fixed point. Gender, being also a human-designed categorization of traits and beliefs, perhaps works the same way. 

Even prehistoric humans noticed that animals (for the most part) are assigned one of just two options for genitals at random, and every society I know of uses genitals to divide people into categories. And so our concepts of masculinity and femininity have grown out of the perceived differences between these groups. But not all cultures experience gender as a single axis. Consider the Wen/Wu concept in mainstream Chinese culture. To simplify to an extreme: The learned scholar (Wen) is as masculine as the veteran warrior (Wu). Unlike mainstream U.S. culture, there is not a single "point" of manliness (Clint Eastwood, in my mind), but rather a spectrum.

The same is true for femininity even here in the U.S. - as Judith Butler wrote in "Gender Trouble" (1990), "... the premature insistence on a stable subject of feminism, understood as a seamless category of women, inevitably generates multiple refusals to accept the category."

As an amab in the U.S, this blew my mind - you're either a muscular individualist with distance from your emotions, or you are failing at being a man. Swimming in the culture of toxic masculinity, it seems that this definition of masculinity must be global or perhaps defined by physical characteristics - but it's not. The persistent misogyny of this mindset also presents "failing at being a man" and therefore being a woman (or queer) as lesser.

Masculinity-by-default means that there are not just two genders, but one - "man" - and people either are in or out of it. This, again, is not original - Luce Irigaray argued in _This Sex Which Is Not One_ (1985) that the "totalizing goal" of toxic masculinity is not the subjugation, but the erasure of femininity altogether. From this standpoint, the idea of the existence of _female_ as a concept is radical feminism.

All of that said, I don't deny that there are common biological differences between people born with XX and XY chromosomes, a point that comes up often when people are trying to argue that gender must match sex. It's easy to sort most people if there's a particular physical characteristic that's required for admission to a group. Perhaps they believe that men have a penis, and women have a uterus, and they can perhaps excuse intersex people as anomalous. For a person who does not distinguish gender and sexuality, it seems completely illogical to say anything else. 

However, we don't go around displaying our sexual organs, so others rely on clues to distinguish which group we belong to. With our current standards of dress, someone wearing a bra is unlikely to have a penis. What would it look like to distinguish between man-the-gender and man-the-sex with different words, perhaps "masculinity" and "male", and not have a word as hopelessly overloaded as "man"? I'm not the first person to propose this - the idea of "gender" was specifically invented by psychologist John Money for the reason of separating physical characteristics and presentation, in 1955.

I will point at other constructed categorizations in which a "given" trait is associated with different personalities: signs in astrology, blood types in Japan, the weekday of your birth in the Akan culture. Unless you are a Japanese/Nigerian medium, at least one of these systems will probably seem arbitrary and illogical to you.

I think sometimes of a world in which people are not divided into arbitrary groups like this. And I find myself frustrated when things are described as masculine or feminine. Why do we call aggression masculine, even when performed by a woman? I try - and often fail - to think of it the other way around. Aggression is not masculine - Masculinity is comprised of aggression, among other traits. A man does not like men because he is gay, he is gay (or bi, or pan...) because he likes men. The traits come first, and we construct a name for these traits that fits into our culture's current ways of thinking. 

With this new vocabulary, you couldn't tell someone to "be more male" as much as you could tell someone to "be more green-eyed". But to tell someone "be more masculine" would ask them to adjust their behavior to match society's vision of masculinity. One could be or look masculine without regard to whether they were male or female, since there is no longer a connection between the two ideas. Gender becomes fluid, instead of fixed.

Butler (1990) writes this better than I:

> The presumption of a binary gender system implicitly retains the belief in a mimetic relation of gender to sex whereby gender mirrors sex or is otherwise restricted by it. When the constructed status of gender is theorized as radically independent of sex, gender itself becomes a free-floating artifice, with the consequence that _man_ and _masculine_ might just as easily signify a female body as a male one, and _woman_ and _feminine_ a male body as easily as a female one.
> This radical splitting of the gendered subject poses yet another set of problems. Can we refer to a “given” sex or a “given” gender without first inquiring into how sex and/or gender is given, through what means? And what is “sex” anyway? Is it natural, anatomical, chromosomal, or hormonal ...

The trans community seems to have mostly dropped the word "transsexual", but let's use it for a moment only in the context of its Latin meaning, "one who has changed sex". In this system that one could be transgender as they move from masculine-presenting to feminine-presenting, and transsexual if they have gender reassignment surgery, but neither would have any bearing on the other. Combine that with dismantling the idea that one particular set of traits is superior, or that changing these traits is bad in any way, and we would have world with a lot less confusion, dysphoria, and self-resentment.

## Claiming an Identity

To claim an identity, one usually needs to feel as though they match all - or at least most - of the general characteristics of that identity. But identities of the gender, sex, kink, attraction, etc. types have no rule-maker who decides which characteristics are in or out. Is a man who is wearing a dress and makeup trans? Not necessarily - they may be trying on a dress and makeup without intent to change their personal, internalized gender identity.

So, what do we seem to agree makes a person trans? There are people who are trans who haven't transitioned (medically or socially), so perhaps it comes down to just the intent / belief / conviction that one is not their originally assigned gender. One might think of trans-ness in this way as made up or fake - but remember that all gender is intrinsic to humanity and therefore entirely created by decisions made by humans - including those who may not agree with the majority.

For some identities, labels, etc., a person must simply believe with conviction that they are, and then they are.

This feels "fake" and unconvincing, both from the outside and the inside. In addition, there are labels for which this does not apply at all, e.g., a person who is born into one culture cannot simply believe that they are another and thus claim that identity. Some have tried - for example, the white woman who "identified" as Black - but with a lot of harm caused. Perhaps a simpler and less contentious example: is someone "kinky" if they never actually have desire for kink play?

To state "I am transgender" with conviction to onesself (although probably the most important step of the entire transition process) does not mean that society accepts you as transgender. Society seems to require (at least?) two things to accept a label: presentation and utterance. Presentation being the actual act of adopting the dress, mannerisms, voice, and so on of another gender. Utterance being the "coming out" process, where you state your labels to others.

Labels evolve and new ones are created. "Top" and "bottom" begat terms like "power bottom" and more recently, "side". There may someday come a day at which no man thinks himself better for being one, at which point "patriarch" and "misogynist" may become defunct. The idea of two "natural", "invariant" genders is already being tossed out by many (although many others seem to be doubling down in response).
