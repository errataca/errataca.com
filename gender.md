## What I think about when I think about Gender

### Gender as a spectrum

I think of gender as a spectrum, and you - as someone reading a site about polyamory and gender - probably do too. You and I have abandoned the idea that one is always masculine or feminine, with nothing in between. We point at the myriad examples around the world of people who do not fit neatly into one of these two boxes when someone hasn't yet reached this realization themselves.

But what do we mean, "a spectrum". Is gender a line segment between "masculine" and "feminine", and one can slide around on that single dimension? Many people do - and surprisingly I'm not unconvinced of it myself. In this way, gender is like race - a societally-created scale on which to categorize people. Unless told otherwise, you are "man" if you have a penis, you are "white" if your skin lacks pigment. In this way, we have tied gender to a specific set of physical characteristics.

I dislike the idea of masculinity and femininity, and think sometimes of a world in which people are not divided into arbitrary groups. And I find myself frustrated when things are described as masculine or feminine. Why do we call aggression masculine, even when performed by a woman? I try - and often fail - to think of it the other way around. Aggression is not masculine - Masculinity is comprised of aggression, among other traits. A man does not like men because he is gay, he are gay because he likes men. The traits come first, and we construct a name for these traits that fits into our culture's current ways of thinking.

There are biological differences between the sexes, a point that comes up often when people are trying to argue that gender must match sex. It's easy to sort most people if there's a particular physical characteristic that's required for admission to a group. Perhaps they believe that men have a penis, and women have a vagina, and they can excuse the intersex as anomolous. But we don't go around displaying our sexual organs, and so then one relies on clues - with our current standards of dress, someone wearing a bra is unlikely to have a penis. What would it look like to distinguish between man-the-gender and man-the-sex with different words: masculinity and male, and not have a word as hopelessly overloaded as "man"?

With this new vocabulary, you couldn't tell someone to "be more male" as much as you could tell someone to "be more green-eyed". But to tell someone "be more masculine" would ask them to adjust their behavior to match society's vision of masculinity. One could be or look masculine withour regard to whether they were male or female, since there is no longer a connection between the two ideas.

In this way of thinking, gender becomes more fluid. The trans community seems to have mostly dropped the word "transsexual", but let's use it for a moment only in the context of its latin meaning, "one who has changed sex". In this system that one could be transgender as they move from masculine-presenting to feminine-presenting, and transsexual if they have gender reassignment surgery, but neither would have any bearing on the other.

Combine that with dismantling the idea that one particular set of traits is superior, or that changing these traits is bad in any way, and we would have world with a lot less confusion, dysphoria, and self-resentment.

## Claiming an Identity

To claim an identity, one usually needs to feel as though they match all - or at least most - of the general characteristics of that identity. But identities of the gender, sex, kink, attraction, etc. types have no rule-maker who decides which characteristics are in or out. We have a general societal consensus that a man who is gay likes men, but is a man who likes men always gay? No - they might identify as pansexual instead, or both. 

So, what do we seem to agree makes a person trans? There are people who are trans who haven't transitioned, so perhaps it comes down to just the intent / belief / conviction that one is not their originally assigned gender.
